// Resistance 3 -- PC port launcher.
//
// One window: a sidebar (Display / Graphics / Upscaling & Frame Gen / Performance /
// Controls / Audio / Interface & Notifications / Advanced / Trophies / Saves & tools /
// About + Play) and a page of settings drawn by hand with GDI+ (no stock controls, so it looks the
// same everywhere and scales with the Windows DPI setting).
//
// Everything is saved the moment it changes:
//   settings.ini  -- the launcher's own choices
//   settings.bat  -- the same choices as `set` lines; run.bat calls it
//   controls.txt  -- keyboard & mouse bindings, read by the game at start
// so run.bat keeps working with or without the launcher.
//
// Build (build.bat does this):
//   clang-cl /nologo /O2 /EHsc project\launcher.cpp /Fe:Launcher.exe /link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS
//            user32.lib gdi32.lib shell32.lib gdiplus.lib dwmapi.lib
